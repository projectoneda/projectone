# Stock Market Investment Strategy - "Sell in May and Go Away"

Sell in May and go away is a well known trading strategy which suggests that investors sell their stocks in May and reinvest in November. 

This strategy supposedly helps investors avoid the volatile May - October period of year. 

Our project will analyze historical performance of the S&P 500 to confirm if stocks truly perform worse during the May 1 to Nov 1 time period

## Assumptions
* For the purpose of simplicity we are focusing only on the effects of time and not taking into account any other external factors such as
    * Stock splits
    * Companies switching industries (within S&P)
    * Dividend reinvesting

## Team Tasks
1. **Alex** - Pull historical stock data from API and convert data to dataframe

2. **Jose** - Performance Calculations 
    * Year over year change of 2 options - time periods
    * Rate of return (RoR)

3. **Don and Layla** - Create charts to visually compare sell in May strategy to baseline of leaving investments as they are 
•	RoR - Index as a whole
•	RoR – Industry Subsectors
•	Industry 
•	Create bar chart to show
•	 Entire year
•	Time period comparison
o	Jan – Apr
o	May – Dec
4. **General Team Tasks**
    * Performance breakdown by industry sector
    * Calculations to understand statistical significance of time period effect on stock performance
        * Z score
        * T test
        * P value
    * How many times has sell in may strategy beat baseline?
    * Does timing affect stock performance of each sector similarly or are does it impact specific sectors more significantly
